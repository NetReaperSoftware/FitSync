Complete Summary: Fixing TextInput Keyboard Stability

  🔍 The Original Problems:

  1. Keyboard collapsed when switching between TextInput fields
  2. Text reverted to placeholders after typing
  3. Network refetches on every input change causing re-renders
  4. Unstable React keys causing component recreation
  5. TouchableWithoutFeedback interference with input focus
  6. Complex focus management causing timing issues

The Problem Symptoms:
1. Keyboard collapsed when switching between TextInput fields
2. Text reverted to placeholders after typing

  🛠️ Solution 1: Fixed Network Refetch Loops

  Problem: Every onUpdateSet call triggered exercises to change → fetchPreviousSetData
  refetch → re-render → keyboard collapse

  Fix: Changed effect dependencies
  // Before:
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (visible && exercises.length > 0) {
      fetchPreviousSetData();
    }
  }, [visible, exercises, fetchPreviousSetData]); // ❌ Refetches on every exercise change

  // After:
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (visible && exercises.length > 0) {
      fetchPreviousSetData(exercises);
    }
  }, [visible]); // ✅ Only fetches when modal opens

  ---
  🛠️ Solution 2: Fixed React Key Stability

  Problem: Unstable keys caused React to recreate components during updates

  Fix: Simplified keys to use stable identifiers
  // Before:
  key={`${exercise.id}-${set.id}-${index}`} // ❌ Index can change

  // After:
  key={set.id} // ✅ Stable unique identifier

  ---
  🛠️ Solution 3: Removed TouchableWithoutFeedback Interference

  Problem: TouchableWithoutFeedback wrapping all content interfered with TextInput focus

  Fix: Completely removed the wrapper and relied on ScrollView's built-in behavior
  // Before:
  <TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={handleBackgroundPress}>
    <View style={styles.content}>
      {/* All interactive content wrapped */}
    </View>
  </TouchableWithoutFeedback>

  // After:
  <ScrollView keyboardDismissMode="on-drag">
    <View style={styles.content}>
      {/* No TouchableWithoutFeedback wrapper */}
    </View>
  </ScrollView>

  🛠️ Solution 4: Simplified Focus Management

  Problem: Complex global focus tracking with timeouts caused interference

  Fix: Removed all complex focus management logic
  // Before: Complex global timeout system
  const [globalFocusedField, setGlobalFocusedField] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const globalBlurTimeoutRef = React.useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);
  // Complex timeout logic in focus/blur handlers

  // After: Simple placeholder handlers
  const handleWeightFocus = React.useCallback(() => {
    // Just a placeholder for future focus logic if needed
  }, []);

  ---
  🛠️ Solution 5: Eliminated Problematic Event Handlers

  Problem: onEndEditing and complex onBlur handlers triggered saving during field switching

  Fix: Removed saving from all input events
  // Before:
  onEndEditing={handleWeightEndEditing} // ❌ Saved on field switch
  onBlur={complexBlurHandler} // ❌ Complex saving logic

  // After:
  // No onEndEditing
  onBlur={handleWeightBlur} // ✅ Empty placeholder function

  ---
  🛠️ Solution 6: Fixed Effect Dependencies

  Problem: Cleanup effect with dependencies ran on every keystroke

  Fix: Used empty dependency array for true unmount-only cleanup
  // Before:
  React.useEffect(() => {
    return () => { /* cleanup that saved values */ };
  }); // ❌ No dependency array = runs on every render

  // After:
  React.useEffect(() => {
    return () => { /* cleanup that saves values */ };
  }, []); // ✅ Empty array = only runs on mount/unmount

  ---
  🛠️ Solution 7: Pure Local State Management

  Problem: TextInput values were being overwritten with processed values

  Fix: Keep user input exactly as typed
  // Local state stays as user typed it:
  const [localWeight, setLocalWeight] = useState('');
  const [localReps, setLocalReps] = useState('');

  // onChangeText only updates local state:
  const handleWeightChange = React.useCallback((text: string) => {
    setLocalWeight(text); // ✅ Keep exactly what user typed
  }, []);

  ---
  🛠️ Solution 8: Deferred Saving Strategy

  Problem: Immediate saving on input events caused re-renders and keyboard collapse

  Fix: Only save values when component actually unmounts
  // Values saved only when:
  // 1. Component unmounts (row deleted)
  // 2. Modal closes
  // 3. Workout finishes
  // NOT when switching between fields

  ---
  🎯 Final Result:

  ✅ Perfect Cross-Field Navigation: Users can switch between any TextInput fields without
  keyboard interruption✅ Unlimited Typing: Users can type numbers of any length without
  issues✅ Text Preservation: User input stays exactly as typed until workout completion✅
  Natural UX: Behaves like standard iOS TextInput behavior✅ Better Performance: No
  unnecessary network requests or re-renders during editing✅ Clean Architecture: Simplified,
   maintainable code without complex state management

  The key insight was that React Native TextInputs need completely isolated local state 
  during editing, with deferred synchronization to parent state only when editing is truly
  complete.
